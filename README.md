# WPGutenbergTest

 - activate op-template
    - in admin Dashboard define the frontend-page and choose the template called "News"
    - activate Plugin: events â€” CGB Gutenberg Block Plugin
    - add the Block called: events cards on the frontend-page
 - mu-plugins folder
      - CPT for News Posts
 - Plugins folder
      - made for my own Gutenberg Block
      it should display selected categories and limited number of posts
      
 # Problem
 
 - when activating the Events - CGB Gutenberg Block Plugin - it is only connected to generic Posts and not to my CPT Posts
